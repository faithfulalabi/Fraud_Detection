# Fraud_Detection: Project Project Overview

* Created a model that classifies if a series of credit card transcations are fraudulent or not fraudulent. For a Fraud transcation it predicts a 1, and a 0 for a non fraudulent transcation. (Recall ~ 82%, Percision ~ 95%, Accuracy ~ 99%).
* Dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
* Performed Unsampling technique to balance out the target variable data.
* Used a Random Forest Classifier, performed some parameter adjustments and optimized it using RandomSearchCV for the best parameters.

## __Motivation__: 

I chose this particular problem because I wanted to improve my classification technique. For every new project I work on I try to improve my approach,learn a new library, and better my modeling technique.


## Dataset Feature Explaination

There are no feature explainations due to confidentiality issues. Features contains only numerical input labeled V1-V28.  

## Data Prepping

The only data preperation I had to do for this dataset was fixing the imbalance in the amount of Fraudulent transcation and none fraudulent transcations. (See the before and after images below).
